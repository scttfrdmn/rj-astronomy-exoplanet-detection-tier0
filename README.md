**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Platform:** Google Colab or SageMaker Studio Lab
**Cost:** $0 (no AWS account needed)
**Data:** ~1.5GB TESS light curve data

## Research Goal

Train a neural network to detect exoplanet transits in TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curves. Identify periodic brightness dips caused by planets passing in front of their host stars.

### Run Locally
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/scttfrdmn/rj-astronomy-exoplanet-detection-tier0.git
cd rj-astronomy-exoplanet-detection-tier0

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook exoplanet-transit-detection.ipynb
```

## What You'll Build

1. **Download TESS data** (~1.5GB light curves, takes 15-20 min)
2. **Preprocess light curves** (detrending, normalization, folding)
3. **Train CNN transit detector** (60-75 minutes on GPU)
4. **Evaluate performance** (precision, recall, ROC curves)
5. **Identify new candidates** (flag potential exoplanets)

## Dataset

**TESS Light Curves**
- Mission: NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
- Stars: ~5,000 light curves from Sectors 1-3
- Cadence: 2-minute and 30-minute observations
- Period: 2018-2024
- Size: ~1.5GB FITS files
- Source: MAST (Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes)

**Classes:**
- Confirmed transits: ~500 stars with known exoplanets
- Non-transits: ~4,500 stars without detected planets
- Injected transits: Synthetic signals for testing

## Colab Considerations

This notebook works on Colab but you'll notice:
- **15-20 minute download** at session start (no persistence)
- **60-75 minute training** (close to timeout limit)
- **Re-download required** if session disconnects
- **~11GB RAM usage** (near Colab's limit)

These limitations become important for real research workflows.

## What's Included

- Single Jupyter notebook (`exoplanet-transit-detection.ipynb`)
- TESS/MAST data access utilities
- 1D CNN architecture for transit detection
- Light curve preprocessing pipeline
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Candidate vetting procedures

## Key Methods

- **Transit photometry:** Detect periodic brightness variations
- **Box Least Squares (BLS):** Period-finding algorithm
- **Convolutional Neural Networks:** Pattern recognition in time series
- **Phase folding:** Align observations by orbital period
- **False positive filtering:** Distinguish planets from stellar variability

## Requirements

**Python:** 3.9+

**Core Libraries:**
- tensorflow or pytorch
- astropy >= 5.0
- lightkurve >= 2.3
- numpy, scipy, pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn

See `requirements.txt` for complete list.

**Compute:**
- RAM: 12 GB minimum
- GPU: Optional but recommended (speeds up training 10x)
- Storage: 2 GB (for downloaded data)

## Scientific Background

### What are Transits?

When a planet passes between its star and Earth, it blocks a small fraction of starlight:
- **Transit depth:** ~0.01-1% brightness drop (depends on planet size)
- **Duration:** Minutes to hours (depends on orbit)
- **Period:** Days to years (orbital period)
- **Shape:** Characteristic U or V-shaped dip

### Why Neural Networks?

Traditional transit detection uses algorithmic approaches (BLS, TLS), but faces challenges:
- **Stellar variability:** Stars naturally vary in brightness
- **Instrumental systematics:** Telescope artifacts mimic transits
- **False positives:** Eclipsing binaries, background stars
- **Computational cost:** Searching millions of periods

CNNs excel at distinguishing real transits from noise by learning:
- Transit shape patterns (ingress, flat bottom, egress)
- Temporal correlations across multiple transits
- Differences from stellar variability and systematics

### TESS Mission

NASA's TESS (launched 2018) surveys the entire sky for transiting planets:
- **Coverage:** 200,000+ stars at 2-minute cadence
- **Magnitude range:** Bright stars (V < 13 mag)
- **Sky coverage:** ~85% of celestial sphere
- **Mission goal:** Find Earth-sized planets around nearby stars

## Performance Expectations

Using this notebook, you can expect:

**Training metrics:**
- Accuracy: ~95% on validation set
- Precision: ~90% (few false positives)
- Recall: ~85% (catches most transits)
- Training time: 60-75 minutes

**Scientific capability:**
- Detect transits with SNR > 7
- Identify planets > 1 Earth radius
- Periods from 1-50 days
- Process ~5,000 light curves per session

**Limitations:**
- Small planets (< 1 R⊕) challenging
- Long periods (> 50 days) need more data
- Single transits not detected
- Grazing transits may be missed

## Troubleshooting

### Data Download Issues
```python
# If MAST servers are slow or timing out
from astroquery.mast import Observations

# Reduce batch size
light_curves = download_tess_data(max_targets=1000)  # instead of 5000

# Or use cached sample data
light_curves = load_sample_data()  # Pre-packaged subset
```

### Out of Memory
```python
# Reduce batch size during training
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=16)  # instead of 32

# Or process light curves in chunks
for chunk in process_in_chunks(light_curves, chunk_size=1000):
    predictions = model.predict(chunk)
```

### Session Timeout
```bash
# Save checkpoint before timeout risk
model.save('transit_detector_checkpoint.h5')

# Resume in next session
model = load_model('transit_detector_checkpoint.h5')
```
